	abstract = {A system of 864 particles interacting with a Lennard-Jones potential and obeying classical equations of motion has been studied on a digital computer ({CDC} 3600) to simulate molecular dynamics in liquid argon at 94.4°K and a density of 1.374 g cm−3. The pair-correlation function and the constant of self-diffusion are found to agree well with experiment; the latter is 15\% lower than the experimental value. The spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation function shows a broad maximum in the frequency region ω=0.25({kBTℏ}). The shape of the Van Hove function Gs(r, t) attains a maximum departure from a Gaussian at about t=3.0×10−12 sec and becomes a Gaussian again at about 10−11 sec. The Van Hove function Gd(r, t) has been compared with the convolution approximation of Vineyard, showing that this approximation gives a too rapid decay of Gd(r, t) with time. A delayed-convolution approximation has been suggested which gives a better fit with Gd(r, t); this delayed convolution makes Gd(r, t) decay as t4 at short times and as t at long times.},

	abstract = {To prevent several kinds of radiation damage caused by charge build-up and by ultraviolet and X-ray photons during etching processes, we have developed a high-performance, neutral-beam etching system. The neutral-beam source consists of an inductively coupled plasma ({ICP}) source and top and bottom carbon parallel plates. The bottom carbon plate includes many apertures for extracting neutral beams from the plasma. By supplying a positive or negative direct current ({DC}) bias to the top and bottom carbon plates in the pulsed {SF}6 plasma, the generated positive or negative ions are respectively accelerated towards the bottom plate. The negative ions are more efficiently converted into neutral atoms in comparison with the positive ions, either by neutralization in charge-transfer collisions with gas molecules during the ion transport or with aperture sidewalls in the bottom plate. The neutralization efficiency of negative ions was more than 98\% and the neutral flux density was equivalent to 4 {mA}/cm2.},

	abstract = {We investigated ion neutralization by collision with graphite by numerical simulation based on time-dependent density functional theory. It is known that the neutral beam source developed by Samukawa (2001 Japan. J. Appl. Phys. Part 2 40 L779), where neutral particles are generated by the collision of ions from plasma with a graphite electrode with numerous high-aspect-ratio apertures, can achieve very high neutralization efficiency of over 90\% when negative ions (Cl−) are used compared with about 60\% when positive ions are used. To understand the neutralization theoretically, we developed a numerical simulator and calculated the dynamic process of electron transfer between an ion and graphite during the whole collision process. Multiple collisions were considered in the calculation. We found that Cl− had higher neutralization efficiency (more than 90\%) than (about 34\%), which is in excellent agreement with the experimental result, so our simulator could successfully simulate the neutralization process. The difference in neutralization efficiency between and Cl− may be due to the relationship between the ion and graphite orbital energy levels.},
